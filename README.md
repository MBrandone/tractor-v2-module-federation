# The Tractor Store - Module federation

## What is The Tractor Store?

The Tractor Store is a template to experiment with micro frontend architecture.
Goal is to create a real world application where developers can experiment with different integration techniques.

The idea is similar to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) or [Movies](https://tastejs.com/movies/), but with a focus on micro frontends. Visit [micro-frontends.org/tractor](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) to learn more.

**Live Demo:** [blueprint.the-tractor.store](https://blueprint.the-tractor.store)

## About This Project

- Three systems: Explore, Decide, Checkout are established along the customer journey (buying process)
- Team missions
    - Explore: Helps the customer to explore and navigate through the broad tractor catalog.
    - Decide: Helps the customer to make an informed buying decision by presenting all necessary details.
    - Checkout: Provides an easy and straight forward checkout process.
- Store that sells tractors
- E-commerce platform (homepage, catalog, product details, cart, checkout, thank you page)
- Special features: Add to cart animation, recommendations, store picker, thank you confetti
- Focus on frontend aspects. Backend and database are mocked with static data.
- Styling is provided in the blueprint. It's not the focus of this project.

## Design Principals

- Each system can be developed and deployed independently by different teams
- The freedom to change a systems technology stack without affecting the others must be guaranteed
- Self-contained systems: Each system has its own database, backend and frontend
- Loose coupling: Systems should be able to function independently of each other as best as possible
- Provide a way to run the entire application locally for development and testing

## Implementation Choices

- All described features must be implemented.
- The concrete implementation is React and module Federation
- Communication between systems is achieved props and custom events
- client-rendering
- An application shell is present
- Deployment can be done with different techniques (container, serverless, static, etc.)
- Bonus objective #1: Extract shared UI components (e.g. the Button) into a shared pattern library.
- Bonus objective #2: The Explore team is getting too big. A new "Inspire" team should be created to take care of product recommendations. Migrate this function to a standalone fourth system.

## Goal of This Project

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for micro frontends.
The goal of this project is to provide a central place, where different micro frontend integration techniques can be compared and evaluated.

- Make pros and cons of different tech-stacks and integration techniques visible and discussable
    - Organizational scalability (more teams, more systems)
    - Technical scalability (more users, more features)
    - Performance characteristics (Core-Web-Vitals, ...)
    - Development experience
- Share knowledge and learnings with the community
- Provide a blueprint for others to experiment with a specific micro frontends tech stack

## Features

### Boundary toggle ‚òëÔ∏è

The project comes with an extra script that highlights that add a small toggle in the bottom right to show the team boundaries.
You can [hotlink](https://blueprint.the-tractor.store/cdn/js/helper.js) the script or host it yourself.

The script looks for elements with `data-boundary` attribute in the DOM and adds a colored box and team label to it. The color is based on the team name.

```html
<!-- üü• red outline -->
<div data-boundary="explore">...</div>

<!-- üü© green outline -->
<div data-boundary="decide">...</div>

<!-- üü® yellow outline -->
<div data-boundary="checkout">...</div>

<!-- üü™ purple outline (bonus task) -->
<div data-boundary="inspire">...</div>

<!-- ‚¨õ gray outline (neutral component) -->
<div data-boundary="appshell,...">...</div>
```

On top-level, you can use `data-boundary-page="..."` to highlight the entire page.

The exact boundary positions are not important as long as your final result looks the same to the end-user and feature responsibility stays as described.

### Concepts üß†

- Inter-team navigation (server- and/or client-side)
- Communication parent-child (variant change > recommendations, add to cart)
- Communication sibling (add to cart > mini cart)
- Communication child-parent (in store pickup > explore )
- Potential client-side interactions (variant change, remove from cart, form validation)
- Nested integration (page > header > mini cart)
- [Bonus] Shared UI components / pattern library (button)
- [Bonus] Migrate recommendations to a new system (Team Inspire)

### Data Structures üíΩ

Each team has its own data model optimized for their tasks.

- üî¥ Team Explore
    - Categories
        - Products (no variants)
    - Stores
    - Recommendations
        - Recommendable variants
        - Color-based algorithm
- üü¢ Team Decide
    - Products
        - Variants (sku, name, highlights)
- üü° Team Checkout
    - Line items
        - Variant (sku, name, price)
        - Inventory
        - Cart state (cookie, sku, quantity)

Use the individual `database.json` files as a data source for each system.
You can render the data directly or build a REST, GraphQL, or other API on top of it.
Check out the [preact implementation](https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-preact) for an already implemented REST API.

**Note:** This repository also contains a global `products.js` and individual `import.js` files.
They contain raw product data and conversion logic to generate the individual `database.json` files.
Similar to a data-replication mechanism in a real-world project. You can ignore these files.

## How To Run Locally

Clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
TODO
```

Install and start dev mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the running application.
Dev-Mode watches for changes in your server-side code.
It does not watch for changes in your client-side JS and CSS code. This is built once on start.
